# odin_recipes
This is a small practice project in which the main (and only) goal is to 
make sure I have learnt some basic notions of HTML.

I will be using:
    1. Paragraph and heading elements
    2. Ordered and unordered lists
    3. Links and images

The task is to simply build a website that contains different recipes made of
a few webpages structured equally in a correct folder format, all accesible from
the index.html page.
